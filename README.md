# gophermail

This package aims to be a simple mail package Go.
Something that the core packages sorely lack.

**It doesn't work yet.**

## Credits

The API is heavily inspired by [`code.google.com/p/appengine-go/appengine/mail`](https://code.google.com/p/appengine-go/source/browse/appengine/mail/mail.go) package.

Lots of copying from [`github.com/AeroNotix/libsmtp`](https://github.com/AeroNotix/libsmtp/blob/master/smtp.go) as well.
